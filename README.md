# Livra

**Goal execution for iOS.** Not a habit tracker. Not a counter.

> *"Most people have a graveyard of abandoned goals. Livra is where goals actually get done — one at a time, in sequence."*

---

## What It Is

Livra is a goal execution app built around a simple idea: finish one thing before starting the next. Users queue goals, track daily marks, and build momentum through a system that believes in them — not one that shames them for missing a day.

**App Store category:** Productivity
**Platform:** iOS (Android planned post-launch)

---

## Core Concepts

### Goals
- Users queue up to 3 goals (free) or unlimited (Livra+), one active at a time
- Completing a goal auto-activates the next
- Completion history is permanent and visible

### Marks
- Daily actions that move a goal forward (Sleep, Workout, Deep Work, Read, etc.)
- Marks live at the user level — they persist across goals
- Users can reorder marks freely; native integrations auto-log from Apple Health

### Daily Check-in
- Single focused interaction, one tap, tied to the active goal

### Weekly Reflection
- Rule-based copy library across 5 performance tiers (strong / solid / inconsistent / missing / first week)
- Human voice throughout — no AI cost at launch

---

## Features

### Free Tier

- Apple Health integrations (Sleep, Workout, Steps, Hydration)
- Custom daily reminders for any mark
- Wake-up alarm deep-link (Sleep mark)
- CSV export
- Cloud backup / restore

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Expo CLI (installed via `npx`)
- iOS Simulator (Mac) or physical device with Expo Go / dev build

### Installation

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd Livra
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key
```

Start the dev server:
```bash
npm start
```

Then press `i` for iOS, `a` for Android, or `w` for web.

### Supabase Setup

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Apply the RLS policies from `SUPABASE_RLS_POLICIES.sql`
3. Deploy the `validate-iap-receipt` Edge Function for subscription validation
4. Copy your project URL and anon key to `.env`

## Architecture Notes

**Marks are user-level, not goal-level.** Marks persist across goals — only the context (why this mark matters now) changes. Do not architect marks as children of goals.

**Offline-first.** All writes go to SQLite first. Supabase sync runs on reconnect. The app is fully functional without a network connection.

**IAP is subscription-only.** No one-time purchase paths remain. Subscription validation runs through a Supabase Edge Function that validates Apple receipts server-side and enforces lapse. Client re-verifies on launch (24h gate) using the stored receipt.

**Reanimated v4.** The mark reorder uses `useSharedValue` / `useAnimatedStyle` / `Gesture.Pan` — no third-party grid libraries. The `babel.config.js` must keep `react-native-reanimated/plugin` last.

## Production Build Checklist

Before building for the App Store:

- [ ] `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` set in `.env`
- [ ] EAS project ID configured in `app.json` (`eas init` if needed)
- [ ] Supabase RLS policies applied
- [ ] `validate-iap-receipt` Edge Function deployed and tested
- [ ] Edge function revocation path active (lapsed subscriptions → `pro_unlocked = false`)
- [ ] Apple Health entitlements configured in EAS credentials
- [ ] Push notification certificate configured

```bash
eas build --platform ios --profile production
eas submit --platform ios
```
